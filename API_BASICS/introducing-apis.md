#   Introducing APIs

##  What is an API?
*   API - Application Programming Interface
*   Can interface with external part of an application
    *   Like a button on a keyboard
    *   Steering wheel and a car
    *   With both, no need to interact with what performs the work

##  Why use APIs?
*   One CAN use these manually
*   However - best used in an automated fashion
    *   Example - Grab new links to shiba inu photos every hour
*   Can also one one API to add functionality to your app
    *   Example - LTTStore uses Stripe to handle payment info
    *   Example - Uber implementing Google Maps to route drivers


##  Why are APIs so popular?
Why reinvent the wheel?
*   More and more applications expose functionality for others to use
*   Scripting languages such as python make it easier for everyone to use APIs
*   ^^ increased demand
*   Nowadays - some GUIs and CLIs built into a product may merely be leveraging it's own APIs
    *   ACI GUI - look closely at the buttons on the web interface
