#   Introducing APIs

##  What is an API?
*   API - Application Programming Interface
*   Can interface with external part of an application
    *   Like a button on a keyboard
    *   Steering wheel and a car
    *   With both, no need to interact with what performs the work

##  Why use APIs?
*   One CAN use these manually
*   However - best used in an automated fashion
    *   Example - Grab new links to shiba inu photos every hour
*
